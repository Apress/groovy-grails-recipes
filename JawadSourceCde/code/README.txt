In order for the examples to work, you will need to have the following installed:

1- JDK version 5.0 or higher
2- Groovy version 1.5.6 or higher
3- Grails version 1.0.3 or higher

There is a seperate folder for each chapter in the book - for example Chapter01,Chapter02..etc. Most of the Groovy examples can be compiled/run with the command: groovy <file_name>. The Grails examples are complete Grails applications that can be run with the command: grails run-app or grails test-app.
